"""
This module includes functions to merge the LandCover_class bands from two
collections and calculate TAC and QA_CR bands for the joined collection

This module implements the fist step of Gafurov & Bardossy

Originally intended to combine Terra (MOD10A1) and Aqua (MYD10A1) MODIS collections 6
Temporal Aggregation (TAC) but can be used to combine any two collections with the same band names.

It implements the preprocessing steps of Gafurov & Bardossy
uses Terra (MOD10A1) and Aqua (MYD10A1) images from collection 6 of MODIS
The scale used for Terra (MOD10A1) and Aqua (MYD10A1) is 463.31271652791656, both projected on 'SR-ORG:6974'

This is based on the js code from - users/observatorionieves/modules/CR/Merge.js

These functions use the following bands:
- LandCover_class: see binary.py for more information on this band

    'LandCover_T' and 'LandCover_A' are equal to the 'LandCover_class' bands calculated for
    Terra and Aqua images respectively.
