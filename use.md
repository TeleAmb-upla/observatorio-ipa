# Usage

## Using Prefix

A prefix is required to read and save images. If no prefix is provided, the script will raise an error.

The prefix should be a string that ends with either an underscore "_" or a hyphen "-". If the provided prefix does not end with these characters, an underscore will be added to it. For example, if the provided prefix is "image", it will be changed to "image_".
